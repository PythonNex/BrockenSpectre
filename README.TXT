BrockenSpectre

The hero of the game is Brocken - a flying multidimensional super-being who has been trapped in a prism prison by the Queen of his home dimension, Valhalla. He can escape the prism by flying at near-luminal speeds; but his relief lasts only as long as he is moving fast.

The Queen, worried that our hero might thwart her prison, has sent the unstoppable Specter to retrieve his soul. The Specter is comprised of the souls of every dead thief in every dimension, and they pursue in eternal turmoil.

Collect enough tesseracts in order transcend your current dimension and continue your search for home. Careful though - the Specter follows you like a shadow...
